# CourseWork
It was the third year course work, there was almost no time, a lot of mistakes and bugs.
I copied here, so that in the future I could correct the errors and update the project to something normal :)

The game is a RPG where you must defend the obelisk and your character from the waves of enemies.

 Also in the game there is something like inventory and shop with items, which is built on the old Unity GUI system.
 This was the period when the release of version 4.6 with the new UI, but due to lack of time it was necessary to combine old and new one.
